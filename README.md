# RNG in ArnoldC

A very basic random number generator in ArnoldC, written for no real reason
other than fun. 

Not debugged at all, wouldn't try anything more complicated than picking
lottery numbers with it. 


To compile, you will need [ArnoldC.jar](http://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC/). Then, 

```
java -jar ArnoldC.jar random.arnoldC
java random
```
