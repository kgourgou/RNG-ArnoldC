# RNG in ArnoldC

A very basic random number generator in ArnoldC, written for no reason
other than fun. 

Not debugged at all, wouldn't try anything more complicated than picking
lottery numbers with it. I accept no responsibility for lost money or faulty fluid simulations while using it. You have been warned!  


To compile, you will need [ArnoldC.jar](http://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC/). Then, 

```
java -jar ArnoldC.jar random.arnoldC
java random
```
